## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a script which will tidy-up data from the Human Activity Recognition database containing the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The script is saved in the file run_analysis.R and outputs a text file with the tidy data named tidy_data.txt.

## Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The original data was obtained from a group of 30 volunteers between 19 and 48 years old. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) while wearing a smartphone (the Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The data was captured using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

A more detailed description of the study design and data collection can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data for this project was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
###Notes on the original (raw) data 
For each record in the dataset, the following is provided: 
- Triaxial (x-, y-, and z-axis) acceleration from the accelerometer and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial (x-, y-, and z-axis) angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- The activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset is divided into two sets, train and test. The training data was generated by 70% of the volunteers and the test data came from the remaining 30% of the volunteers.

Within both the train and test data sets are three files:
- X_test.txt: Each row contains a measurement. The label for each measurement is contained in the features.txt file.
- y-test.txt: Each row identifies the activity being performed while taking the measurement, ranging from 1 to 6. The number corresponds to an activity label contained in the activity_labels.txt file.
- subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity ranging from 1 to 30.

##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
The following steps should be taken to create the tidy data file:

1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the file and extract into a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" within the working directory of the run_analysis.R script.
3. In R, open the file run_analysis.R and source the script. This will clean the data and create the tidy dataset.

###Cleaning of the data
The following steps are taken to clean the data a create the tidy data set:
1. The training and the test data sets are merged to create one data set.
2. For each measurement, the mean and standard deviation measures are extracted.
3. The activities are renamed with descriptive activity names.
4. The data set columns are labeled with descriptive variable names. 
5. A tidy data set is created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
